## Introduction

We have rewrote the SnuPL compiler in the Swift language.

### Motivation

The unfamiliarity on the C++ language pushed us to experiment with
porting the compiler to a more familiar language.

Partially porting the parser to Swift showed a significant
productivity increase not only from familiarity but also from the
conciseness of the language, algebric data types, and pattern
matching.

We decided to use the Swift port as a sandbox for experimenting with
various design deviations from the original design.

### Design Goals

The following were the goals when starting the rewrite:

- Each phase has a component that is responsible for it.
- These components must communicate with plain data structures that do
  not have any behavioral knowledge of phases.
- To report multiple errors, each phase tries hard enough to make
  something, with a list of encountered errors.

While these goals were not totally achieved, we believe that

### Data Structures

The tokens

### Known Problems / Possible Improvements

The biggest known problem is that the `Resolver` does not do any error
handling in its current form. While the appropriate functions are
marked throwing, and basically.

## Syntax Analysis

The parser is a simple LL(1) parser.

## Phase 3: Semantic Analysis

The `Resolver` of SwiftSnuPL has two responsibilities:

- Resolving the tokens to the appropriate symbols
- Calculating the types of various expressions

Notably, instead of the parser resolving the symbols during parsing,
we handle symbol resolving in phase 3.

As SwiftSnuPL has static scoping rules, the notion of scopes do not
have to exist outside of the `Resolver`; it maintains an internal
stack of scopes during resolving, and the scopes do not have any
presence after this phase.

Scopes contain multiple `Symbol`s,

To support `const` symbols, the `Resolver` implements a simple
compile-time evaluator. Since the `Parser` only allows a separate

SwiftSnuPL also completes phase 3. The SwiftSnuPL Resolver handles
both symbol resolving and type checking, covering a subset of phase 2
and phase 3. The Resolver saves type and symbol information on an side
table separately from the parser AST. This not only allows the parser
to continue and parse the code, and report resolver errors in a batch,
but also allows centralizing resolving and type checking logic. The
resolver finally produces a map of AST nodes to type information and
resolved Symbols.


### Architecture

Resolver only receives tree of SnuPL/2 codes, then generate various
informations for later phase.
```swift
class Resolver {
    var module: Parser.Module // input
    
    // results
    var resolvedSymbols: [Token: Symbol] = [:]
    var resolvedTypes: [Parser.Expression: `Type`] = [:]
    var globalVariables: Set<String> = []
```

`module` is root node of tree, semantically it means whole source code
of SnuPL/2. It contains structures of source code, which determined at
earlier phase(parser). `resolvedSymbols` is dictionary that connects
`Token` and `Symbol`, which related to first responsibility of
resolver. `Symbol` is similar with `Token`, but it has ability to
check semantic equality between token. It will be explained more in
later part. `resolvedTypes` is dictionary that connects
`Parser.Expression` and `Resolver.Type`, which related to second
responsibility of resolver. 

### Core Logic

Phase 3 starts from `resolve()` function.
```swift
func resolve() throws {
    func builtin(withSignature signature: StaticString) -> Symbol {
        // process signature...
        return .`var`(token: token, type: type)
    }

    let globalSymbols: Set<Symbol> = [
        builtin(withSignature: "DIM(_[] I)I"), builtin(withSignature: "DOFS(_[])I"),
        builtin(withSignature: "ReadInt()I"), builtin(withSignature: "ReadLong()L"),
        builtin(withSignature: "WriteInt(I)"), builtin(withSignature: "WriteLong(L)"),
        builtin(withSignature: "WriteChar(C)"), builtin(withSignature: "WriteStr(C[])"),
        builtin(withSignature: "WriteLn()"),
    ]

    resolveSymbol(of: module.name, as: builtin(withSignature: "main()"))
    try resolve(block: module.block, symbols: globalSymbols, return: nil)
}
```
At first global symbols such as `DIM()`, `DOFS()`, `WriteInt()` are
resolved and added in global scope. Then try resolve every source code
in main module. `resolve()` function has 3 different overload
types. One gets `Parser.Block`, other one gets `Parser.Statement`, and
last one gets `Parser.Expression`. Each function logic is pretty
straightforward - respond to case by case. However especially in
resolve `Parser.Block`, every declaration in that block are processed
before statements are resolved. variables/constants added into current
scope and resolved results added into `resolvedSymbol`.

```swift
func resolve(block: Parser.Block, symbols: Set<Symbol> = [], return: `Type`?) throws {
    var scope = Scope(symbols: symbols, return: `return`)
    for declaration in block.declarations {
        switch declaration {
        case .`var`(let name, let type):
            if block == module.block {
                scope.addGlobalVar(token: name, type: try withScope(scope) { try evaluate(type: type) })
                globalVariables.insert(name.string)
            } else {
                scope.addVar(token: name, type: try withScope(scope) { try evaluate(type: type) })
            }
            try withScope(scope) { try resolveSymbol(of: name) }
        // case by case...
        }
    }
    
    try withScope(scope) { for statement in block.body { try resolve(statement: statement) } }
}
```

And it is a example from resolving `.call` case of
`Parser.Expression`.
```swift
func resolve(expression: Parser.Expression) throws {
    switch expression {
    case .call(let function, let arguments):
        try resolve(expression: function)
        for argument in arguments { try resolve(expression: argument) }
        guard case .function(parameters: let parameters, return: let `return`) = try resolvedType(of: function)
        else { fatalError() }
        for (parameter, argument) in zip(parameters, arguments) {
            guard try resolvedType(of: argument).isConvertible(to: parameter) else { fatalError() }
        }
        resolveType(of: expression, as: `return`)
    // case by case...
    }
}
```

#### Helper Functions
Code belows are helper functions that managing outputs of resolver.
```swift
func resolveSymbol(of token: Token) throws {
    for scope in scopes.reversed() {
        if let symbol = scope.findSymbol(named: token.string) {
            resolveSymbol(of: token, as: symbol)
            return
        }
    }
    fatalError()
}

func resolveSymbol(of token: Token, as symbol: Symbol) { resolvedSymbols[token] = symbol }
func resolveType(of expression: Parser.Expression, as type: `Type`) { resolvedTypes[expression] = type }

func resolvedSymbol(of token: Token) throws -> Symbol {
    guard let symbol = resolvedSymbols[token] else { fatalError() }
    return symbol
}
func resolvedType(of expression: Parser.Expression) throws -> `Type` {
    guard let type = resolvedTypes[expression] else { fatalError() }
    return type
}
```
`resolveSymbol(Token)` find symbols in reverse order of nested scope,
which means find nearest symbol definition.


### Evaluation of Constants
Evaluation of constants are one of important role of resolver. Every
initializer of constant is `Parser.Expression`, so evaluation logic is
starts from this:
```swift
func evaluate<T: Hashable>(expression: Parser.Expression, as type: T.Type) throws -> T {
    try evaluate(expression: expression) as! T
}

func evaluate(expression: Parser.Expression) throws -> AnyHashable {
    switch expression {
    case .binary:
        // blabla...
    // case by case...
    }
}
```

It isn't that worth to comment about `evaluate()` implementation since
it is similar as parsing logic. However there is one thing in process
`.binary` case - arithmetic / equality / relational calculation is
implemented by generic of Swift primitive type.
```swift
func arithmetic<T: BinaryInteger>(as type: T.Type) throws -> T {
    let leftValue = try evaluate(expression: left, as: T.self)
    let rightValue = try evaluate(expression: right, as: T.self)
    switch `operator`.string {
    case "+": return leftValue + rightValue
    case "-": return leftValue - rightValue
    case "*": return leftValue * rightValue
    case "/": return leftValue / rightValue
    default: fatalError()
    }
}

func equality<T: Equatable & Hashable>(as type: T.Type) throws -> Bool {
    let leftValue = try evaluate(expression: left, as: T.self)
    let rightValue = try evaluate(expression: right, as: T.self)
    switch `operator`.string {
    case "=": return leftValue == rightValue
    case "#": return leftValue != rightValue
    default: fatalError()
    }
}

func relational<T: Comparable & Hashable>(as type: T.Type) throws -> Bool {
    let leftValue = try evaluate(expression: left, as: T.self)
    let rightValue = try evaluate(expression: right, as: T.self)
    switch `operator`.string {
    case "=": return leftValue == rightValue
    case "#": return leftValue != rightValue
    default: fatalError()
    }
}

// Real evaluation logic
if leftType == .integer && rightType == .integer {
    switch `operator`.string {
    case "+", "-", "*", "/": return try arithmetic(as: Int32.self)
    case "=", "#": return try equality(as: Int32.self)
    case "<", "<=", ">=", ">": return try relational(as: Int32.self)
    default: fatalError()
    }
} else if { // keep going...
```

### Semantic Rule Checklist

List below is semantic rules which we are considered during Phase 3:
- Type Checking
  - compatible type at binary, unary operator
  - compatible type at assignment, declaration
  - boolean expression on if, while statement
  - integer/longint range check
  - Procedure/Function
    - compatible declaration, return type
    - compatible parameter, argument type(and same number)
  - Array
    - dimension/int type check on subscript
    - size must be provided in declaration
- Valid Identifier
  - duplicate declaration in same scope
  - invalid(undefined) symbol
  - Module/Subroutine: identifier match
- SnuPL/2 specific issues
  - prohibit use of composite type in return and assign
  - implicit type conversion of array parameter, argument

Also there are some differences from CppSnuPL, or some decisions in
various candidates of semantic rules.

- prohibit implicit integer/longint conversion
- usage of strict constant folding
- Array subscription is only allowed with `integer` type. `longint`
  type isn't allowed. 
- String constant declaration is only way to initialize array
  type. Conversely, it means that we can evaluate though some char
  constant's initial value is defined by subscript on string. It will
  be compiled successfully.
- Subarray in arguments is **allowed**. It depends on memory structure
  of array, so we will discuss in phase 4 parts.


### Enums and Structs

#### Type
`Type` in resolver is distinguished from `Type` in parser. In
resolver, it treat procedure/function as type, too. This mental model
helps processing procedure/function call, and easy to extend features
at SnuPL/2 such as array of procedure, or array of function. 

```swift
indirect enum `Type`: Equatable, Hashable {
    case boolean
    case char
    case integer
    case longint
    case array(base: `Type`?, size: Int32?)  // base is only nil if array is untyped
    case procedure(parameters: [`Type`])
    case function(parameters: [`Type`], `return`: `Type`)

    var isScalar: Bool {
        switch self {
        case .boolean, .char, .integer, .longint: return true
        default: return false
        }
    }

    func isAssignable(to target: Self) -> Bool { target.isScalar && isConvertible(to: target) }

    func isConvertible(to target: Self) -> Bool {
        switch self {
        case .array(let base, let size):
                guard case .array(base: let targetBase, size: let targetSize) = target else { return false }
                guard let targetBase = targetBase else { return true }
                guard let base = base else { return false }
                guard base.isConvertible(to: targetBase) else { return false }
                guard let targetSize = targetSize else { return true }
                return size == targetSize
        // case by case...
        }
    }
}
```

`Type` has helpers like `isScalar`, `isAssignable`,
`isConvertible`. In case of compare array type in `isConvertible`, it
recursively compares type of `base` and `size`. Similar methods are
exist at CppSnuPL, but SwiftSnuPL declare different type
representation in different phase to accomplish separation of
concerns. Also from powerful Swift native features sum type like
`Type` can be implemented much shorter than C++.


#### Symbol
`Symbol` is semantic representation of variable and constant
tokens. According to this facts, enum `Symbol` is consisted of 2
cases. 

```swift
enum Symbol: Equatable, Hashable {
    case `var`(token: Token, type: `Type`, isGlobal: Bool = false)
    case const(token: Token, type: `Type`, initializer: AnyHashable, isGlobal: Bool = false)

    var token: Token {
        switch self {
        case .`var`(let token, _, _): return token
        case .const(let token, _, _, _): return token
        }
    }

    var type: `Type` {
        switch self {
        case .`var`(_, let type, _): return type
        case .const(_, let type, _, _): return type
        }
    }
    
    var isGlobal: Bool {
        switch self {
        case .`var`(_, _, let isGlobal): return isGlobal
        case .const(_, _, _, let isGlobal): return isGlobal
        }
    }
}
```

Each case has `token`, `type`, `isGlobal` attributes in
common. `const` case has `initializer` attributes because constant
declaration forces initializing when declare it. `isGlobal` attributes
will used in Backend(Phase 5) to search variable/constant position in
memory, which are distinguished from local variable/constant in
sections to store. 


#### Scope
`Scope` is defined, used in resolver, but it won't affect any other
phases. `Scope` is needed just checking semantic errors in source
code, and matching `Token` and `Symbol`. We are trying to hide
informations about SnuPL/2 grammar from other phases. struct `Scope`
has methods about adding new variable/constant, and search symbol in
current scope.

```swift
struct Scope {
    var symbols: Set<Symbol>
    let `return`: `Type`?

    mutating func addGlobalVar(token: Token, type: `Type`) {
        symbols.insert(.`var`(token: token, type: type, isGlobal: true))
    }
    mutating func addGlobalConst(token: Token, type: `Type`, initializer: AnyHashable) {
        symbols.insert(.const(token: token, type: type, initializer: initializer, isGlobal: true))
    }
    mutating func addVar(token: Token, type: `Type`) { symbols.insert(.`var`(token: token, type: type)) }

    mutating func addConst(token: Token, type: `Type`, initializer: AnyHashable) {
        symbols.insert(.const(token: token, type: type, initializer: initializer))
    }

    func findSymbol(named name: String) -> Symbol? { symbols.first(where: { $0.token.string == name }) }
}
```


## Phase 4: Intermediate Code Generation

### Architecture

The Swift `Generator` converts a parsed module with resolver
information to the IR, which is basically two dictionaries; a
symbol-to-instructions mapping that represents the TEXT section, and a
symbol-to-strings mapping that represents the DATA section. Also it
gets source code tree, too. As a result, Generator made linearize
tree - TAC - and some additional information about allocations and
string literals.
```swift
class IRGenerator {
    let module: Parser.Module
    let resolvedSymbols: [Token: Resolver.Symbol]
    let resolvedTypes: [Parser.Expression: Resolver.`Type`]
    
    var allocations: [String: Int64] = [:]
    var stringLiterals: [String: [UInt8]] = [:]
}
```

Module, procedure, function can be treated as independent source code
fracture, which means we can generate each of TAC. It leads generator
execution starts from module, and procedure/function declarations.
```swift
func generate() -> [Resolver.Symbol: [Instruction]] {
    var instructions: [Resolver.Symbol: [Instruction]] = [:]
    for declaration in module.block.declarations {
        switch declaration {
        case .procedure(let name, let parameters, let block):
            guard let block = block else { continue }
            let symbol = resolvedSymbol(of: name)
            instructions[symbol] = makeInstructions(parameters: parameters, block: block)
        case .function(let name, let parameters, _, let block):
            guard let block = block else { continue }
            let symbol = resolvedSymbol(of: name)
            instructions[symbol] = makeInstructions(parameters: parameters, block: block)
        default: continue
        }
    }
    let symbol = resolvedSymbol(of: module.name)
    instructions[symbol] = makeInstructions(module: module)
    return instructions
}
```

### Core Logic

The compilation to the IR is quite straightforward; There aren't many
things to explain internal implementation detail of
SwiftSnuPL. However, there are some interesting decisions for such features:

To allow passing subarrays between functions, the binary layout of
arrays are changed. Each array has a 8-byte header, consisting of two
4-byte little-endian integer values representing 1) the size of all
items (e.g. the size of items multiplied by the count of items), and
2) the size of one item. Nested arrays gets a nested layout.

This implementation allows arrays to be nested, and DIM can be
implemented as N-dimensional arrays get to have 8N bytes allocated as
a header, so calculating the length of the k-th dimension becomes
dividing the integer between the 2k-th integer and 2k+1-th integer.

Another advantage of the item size header is that we can dynamically
select store/load instructions, allowing for example passing integer
arrays to longint arrays, or vice versa.

This unfortunately means that storing an item to the array requires
two memory reads and a branch, which is probably quite detrimental to
performance. Thankfully we’re not concerned on performance at this
stage, so this working well is enough for us.

Another interesting tidbit is that we allocate the array on the stack,
even if the symbol for the array is global; due to how we do not give
any distinction between local arrays and passed arrays, all variables
typed array is basically just a pointer, even in the case where the
array was declared locally. In this case, it is the pointer to the
stack allocation that becomes a global symbol.



### Enums and Structs

The IR is almost the same with the provided CppSnuPL TAC;

`Operand` represents 64-bit scalar values that can either be a
constant, a register value, or a value on the stack. Stack allocations
are represented as pointers as well. Only the `.symbol` and
`.temporary` cases are modifiable; others are constant operands.

We did not model this distinction as separate types for brevity;
though we could have separate types for mutable operands and constant
operands, and declare the IR more strictly.

```swift
enum Operand: Equatable, Hashable {
    case constant(Int64)
    case temporary(name: String)
    case string(name: String)
    case allocation(name: String)
    case symbol(Resolver.Symbol)
}
```

The IR is modeled as below:

```swift
enum Instruction {
    case move(destination: Operand, source: Operand)
    case unary(op: UnaryOp, destination: Operand, source: Operand)
    case binary(op: BinaryOp, destination: Operand, source1: Operand, source2: Operand)
    case parameter(destination: Operand, index: Int)

    case jump(destination: String)
    case branch(destination: String, source1: Operand, source2: Operand)  // branch if equal
    case call(destination: Operand?, symbol: Resolver.Symbol, arguments: [Operand])
    case `return`(value: Operand?)

    case load(destination: Operand, source: Operand, size: MemorySize)
    case store(source: Operand, destination: Operand, size: MemorySize)

    case label(name: String)
}
```

As we can see, `UnaryOp` and `BinaryOp` is defined in generator. They
are defined like this:
```swift
enum UnaryOp: Equatable, Hashable {
    case neg
    case pos
    case not
}

enum BinaryOp: Equatable, Hashable {
    case add
    case sub
    case mul
    case div
    case and
    case or

    case eq
    case neq
    case lt
    case leq
    case gt
    case geq
}
```

Finally, since SnuPL/2 has 3 types of memory size of their primitive
types, it is defined as enum `MemorySize`.
```swift
enum MemorySize: Equatable, Hashable {
    case byte
    case word
    case doubleWord
}
```
